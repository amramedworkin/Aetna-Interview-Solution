' === Login Flow (External and Prior) ===
User --> Portal : Logs in (via OAuth2)
Portal --> Cognito : Initiates Auth Flow (OAuth2/OIDC)
Cognito --> Portal : Returns ID and Access Tokens
note right of Portal
  Auth occurs outside Movie API scope.\n
  This portal acquires Cognito tokens\n
  for use in API calls via API Gateway.
end note

' === API Interaction Flow ===
User --> DNS : movie-api.company.com
DNS --> WAF : Secure Routing
WAF --> ACM : TLS Termination
WAF --> ALB : HTTPS Request
ALB --> APIGW : API Traffic
APIGW --> Cognito : Token Verification
APIGW --> API : Forwarded Request
API --> RDS : Secure JDBC (IAM Auth)
API --> Secrets : Fetch DB Credentials
API --> CW : Logs, Metrics
API --> XRay : Traces
CW --> SNS : Alerts
SNS --> DevOps : Notification
SNS --> Security : Security Alerts
API --> ECR : Docker Image Pull
XRay --> PerfAnalyst : Trace Analysis
